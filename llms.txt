Fetch and analyze Michigan school enrollment data from the Center for
Educational Performance and Information (CEPI) in R or Python.

## Why this package exists

This package is part of the [State Schooldata
Project](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata), which provides a
simple, consistent interface for accessing state-published school data
in Python and R. The original
[njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata) package for
New Jersey inspired this effort to cover all 50 states.

Michigan publishes detailed enrollment data through CEPI, but the files
are scattered across multiple URLs, use different formats by year, and
require significant cleaning. This package handles all of that
complexity so you can focus on analysis.

## What can you find with mischooldata?

**30 years of enrollment data (1996-2025).** 1.4 million students. 880+
districts. Here are fifteen stories hiding in the numbers:

### 1. Detroit’s collapse is staggering

Detroit Public Schools has lost over 100,000 students since 2000. The
district went from 154,648 students in 2000 (as Detroit City School
District) to 48,117 in 2025 (as Detroit Public Schools Community
District after a 2016 restructuring). This represents one of the most
dramatic urban enrollment declines in American education history.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

# Note: Detroit district ID changed from 82010 to 82015 in 2016 restructuring
enr_long <- fetch_enr_multi(c(2000, 2005, 2010, 2020, 2025), use_cache = TRUE)

enr_long %>%
  filter(is_district,
         grepl("Detroit City|Detroit Public Schools Community", district_name),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 3

### 2. Statewide enrollment has been declining

Michigan has lost over 100,000 students since 2018 alone, reflecting
demographic shifts and economic changes. The state peaked at around 1.7
million K-12 students and now serves approximately 1.4 million.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2
#>   end_year n_students
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2018    1468256

### 3. Grand Rapids is more diverse than you think

Michigan’s second-largest city has become majority-minority, with
Hispanic enrollment growing fastest. Grand Rapids Public Schools now has
39.5% Hispanic, 30.1% Black, 22.1% White, and 1.0% Asian students.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Grand Rapids Public", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2025,
         subgroup %in% c("white", "black", "hispanic", "asian")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1))
#> # A tibble: 4 x 3
#>   subgroup n_students   pct
#>   <chr>         <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 white          2997  22.1

### 4. The Upper Peninsula is emptying out

UP districts have lost over 30% of students since 2000 as the region’s
population ages and young families move south. Combined enrollment in
Marquette, Houghton, Iron Mountain, and Menominee area districts dropped
from 11,280 to 7,733.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr_long <- fetch_enr_multi(c(2000, 2005, 2010, 2020, 2025), use_cache = TRUE)

up_districts <- c("Marquette", "Houghton", "Iron Mountain", "Menominee")
enr_long %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl(paste(up_districts, collapse = "|"), district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  group_by(end_year) %>%
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   end_year n_students
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2000      11280

#> 4     2020       7975
#> 5     2025       7733
```

### 5. COVID hit kindergarten hard

Michigan lost nearly 14,000 kindergartners in 2021 (from 120,133 in 2020
to 106,539 in 2021) and hasn’t fully recovered. The pandemic disrupted
the transition to formal schooling for thousands of Michigan families.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "K") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2

### 6. Ann Arbor: island of stability

While Detroit hemorrhages students, Ann Arbor Public Schools maintains
around 16,800 students with high diversity. The university town’s
economic stability and educated workforce create a different enrollment
trajectory.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Ann Arbor Public Schools", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2
#>   end_year n_students
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2018      17669
#> 2     2019      17950
#> 3     2020      17942
#> 4     2021      17386
#> 5     2022      17016
#> 6     2023      16961

### 7. Multiracial enrollment growing fastest

Multiracial students are Michigan’s fastest-growing demographic,
increasing 31% from 57,291 to 75,055 students since 2018. While overall
enrollment declines, multiracial and Hispanic populations continue to
grow.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "multiracial", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2
#>   end_year n_students
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2018      57291
#> 2     2019      60457

### 8. Largest districts by enrollment

The 10 largest districts represent a mix of urban, suburban, and diverse
communities. Detroit remains the largest despite decades of decline,
followed by suburban powerhouses like Utica and Dearborn.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr_current <- fetch_enr(2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr_current %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 2

### 9. Flint’s water crisis visible in enrollment

Flint, School District of the City of, has lost 44% of students since
2018, dropping from 4,503 to 2,541. The water crisis accelerated an
already declining enrollment as families fled the city.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Flint, School District", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2

### 10. Oakland County suburbs holding

Oakland County districts like Troy, Rochester, Novi, and Farmington
maintain strong enrollment while Detroit collapses. These affluent
suburbs benefit from strong economies and excellent school reputations.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

oakland <- c("Troy", "Rochester", "Novi", "Farmington")
enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl(paste(oakland, collapse = "|"), district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL", end_year == 2025) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students))
#> # A tibble: 4 x 2
#>   district_name                    n_students

### 11. Dearborn: Arab American educational hub

Dearborn City School District serves one of the largest Arab American
communities in the nation with 19,168 students. The district maintains
stable enrollment with a unique demographic profile.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Dearborn City", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2

### 12. Black student enrollment declining

Black student enrollment in Michigan has declined from 260,423 in 2018
to 246,009 in 2025, driven primarily by Detroit’s collapse. This
demographic shift is reshaping the state’s educational landscape.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "black", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2
#>   end_year n_students
#>      <dbl>      <dbl>
#> 1     2018     260423
#> 2     2019     256379

### 13. Lansing bucking the urban decline

Unlike Detroit and Flint, Lansing Public School District has maintained
relatively stable enrollment around 10,000 students. The state capital’s
diverse economy and state government employment provide a buffer.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, grepl("Lansing Public School District", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE),
         subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2

### 14. High school enrollment shrinking faster

High school grades are shrinking faster than elementary grades
statewide, as the birth rate decline from the 2008 recession reaches
secondary schools.

``` r
library(mischooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025, use_cache = TRUE)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05",
                            "09", "10", "11", "12")) %>%
  mutate(level = ifelse(grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05"),
                        "Elementary (K-5)", "High School (9-12)")) %>%
  group_by(end_year, level) %>%

### 15. Demographic transformation: Michigan’s changing face

Michigan’s racial demographics are shifting. White students now make up
62.6% (855,383), Black 18.0% (246,009), Hispanic 9.5% (129,236),
Multiracial 5.5% (75,055), and Asian 3.8% (51,423).

### Python

``` python
import pymischooldata as mi

# Check available years
years = mi.get_available_years()
print(f"Data available from {years['min_year']} to {years['max_year']}")
#> Data available from 1996 to 2025

# Fetch one year
enr_2025 = mi.fetch_enr(2025)

# State totals
state_total = enr_2025[
    (enr_2025['is_state'] == True) &
    (enr_2025['subgroup'] == 'total_enrollment') &

## Data Notes

### Data Source

All data is sourced directly from the Michigan Center for Educational
Performance and Information (CEPI): - Main portal:
<https://www.mischooldata.org/> - Data files:
<https://www.mischooldata.org/student-enrollment-counts-data-files/> -
CEPI home: <https://www.michigan.gov/cepi>

### Available Years

- **Full range:** 1996-2025 (30 school years)
- **Note:** 2015 data uses `.xlsb` format which requires special
  handling

### Collection Period

Michigan enrollment data is collected on **Count Day**, typically the
first Wednesday in October (Fall Count) and the second Wednesday in
February (Spring Count). This package uses Fall Count data.

### Suppression Rules

CEPI suppresses (shows as blank/NA) student counts when: - Cell counts
are less than 10 students for demographic breakdowns - The suppression
is necessary to prevent identification of individual students

### Known Data Quality Issues

1.  **Detroit restructuring (2016):** Detroit City School
    District (82010) was restructured as Detroit Public Schools
    Community District (82015) in 2016. Historical analysis should
    account for this ID change.

2.  **Charter school proliferation:** Michigan has ~300 charter schools
    (PSAs - Public School Academies) which are counted as separate
    districts.

3.  **Schools of Choice:** Inter-district enrollment means some students
    are counted in districts different from their residence.

### Entity Levels

- **State:** Statewide totals
- **District:** 880+ traditional public school districts plus charter
  schools
- **Building:** 3,500+ individual schools

### District/Building Codes

- **District Code:** 5 digits (e.g., 82015 = Detroit Public Schools)
- **Building Code:** 5 digits
- **ISD Code:** First 2 digits of district code indicate Intermediate
  School District

### Key ISDs (Intermediate School Districts)

| Code | ISD Name        | Major Districts       |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| 82   | Wayne RESA      | Detroit, Dearborn     |
| 63   | Oakland Schools | Troy, Rochester, Novi |
| 50   | Macomb ISD      | Utica, Warren         |
| 33   | Kent ISD        | Grand Rapids          |

## Part of the State Schooldata Project

This package is part of a larger effort to provide simple, consistent
access to state-published school data across all 50 states. The project
started with [njschooldata](https://github.com/almartin82/njschooldata)
(New Jersey) and has expanded to cover the entire country.
